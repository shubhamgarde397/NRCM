Today a thought came into my mind
A thought big enough to replay all the memories
I saw a post with kids playing in the rains.
Yes the month of June which is about to begin,
The Good summer vaccations are over and kids are now returning home from their Mamacha gaav.
Now just put yourself in this train of thoughts it will be beautiful I bet.

A last few days remaining of your summer vaccations, so you enjoy the best with your brothers and your sisters.
Packing all of your stuff and leaving for your home town.
You reach home and the smell of your house just melts your heart, you missed it real bad.
Seeing your mother and father makes you wanna cry.
